# Bomberman-Game
Simple Bomberman Game made in c++ with sfml (for windows)

To run the app open bomber.exe or if you want to do so from your IDE you will have to link sfml liblaries
I worked in visual studio but other IDEs should be just fine (some helpful libs are included)

Player control:
player1: movement w,s,a,d, bomb: space
player2: movement arrow keys, bomb: right shift

Note:
Player gets slowed if in contact with walls (slime effect)
You can pause/unpause the game with escape button
